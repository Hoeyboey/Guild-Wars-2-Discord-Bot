# Guild Wars 2 Bot

Hi there! I made a bot for Discord that tells you what today's daily quests are in Guild Wars 2. It's pretty simple: run the bot, invite it to your server, and type !daily in to the chat to have it tell you what today's quests are. 

To run the bot, you'll have to create one through Discord, because I can't share mine with you (ToS and all that). You can do it through the Discord site, and then you need to create a file called bot_credentials.py, put it in the same folder as all of this, make sure it has a variable called secret_token, and give it your bot's secret token (again, can't share mine, don't want to break Discord's ToS).

Invite that bot to your server, and away you go!
